	 <pre>
	   TODON where do all these screens come from? From this single line "static scaffold = true".
	         CRUD (create, read, update, delete) come shipped with Grails. Most of the time not very useful
	         for customer-facing screens, but quite useful for if you need some admin screens done pronto.
	         
	         For more information, take a look at <a href='http://grails.org/plugin/scaffolding'>the scaffolding plugin</a>,
	         which will be installed in Grails Projects by default.
	         
	         Note: we've overwritten the default Grails templates with our own, to make them more trekkish. 
	         You'll find them in src/templates/scaffolding.
